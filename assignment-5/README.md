This project loads and queries all of my address data as well as the first time associated with each address. My plan was to create a new object for each start time in the text, but I wasn't able to separate the times into individual objects, unfortunately.


<br>
<br>
My final query aggregation file of partial times is: https://github.com/ryezzz/data-structures/blob/master/assignment-5/mongo_aggregation_result.JSON 
<br>
<br>
My parsing code for the above result is at:
https://github.com/ryezzz/data-structures/blob/master/assignment-5/v2assignment-2.js
<br>
<br>
My my in-progressing parsing file is here:

Here's a database creation process summary:
